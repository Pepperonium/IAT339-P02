      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>As adults, we tend to be more conscious of what goes into and onto our bodies by choosing the right ingredients. Though, is it the same case with baby products?</p>
      <p>We discovered that most baby skincare products are made from common unnatural ingredients that may be toxic and harmful to children. However, such ingredients are still being used in products as it is the easiest and fastest way to solve and target children’s skin needs and problems.</p>
      <p>Thus, Little Bee was established to focus on providing high-quality skin care products for children using only natural ingredients with biodegradable packaging. With continuous research and testing, we have developed skincare products that can help with children’s skin conditions without using unnatural ingredients that may harm children in the long term.</p>
      <p>Little Bee also provides customized and personalized skin care products that can cater any functional and aesthetic needs by taking quizzes to see what best fits for your children.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>We want to provide children the best experience when using skincare products by meeting the wants and needs of every single children.</p>
